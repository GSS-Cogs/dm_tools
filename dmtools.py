    This method searches through a directory of codelist csv files looking for instances of each value within the codes list.
    It records in what file it finds the instance and outputs a csv file with a list of the codes, the file it cound it in and the number of times it was found.
    It also outputs a csv file giving the percentage of split between the files, which codes were found in. 
    Method assumes directory only has files with extensions .csv and .csv-metadata.json.
    This methods takes as its arguments:
        codes: A list of unique values taken from a datasets column within a transform
        pth: This is the path to the codelists you want to search through
        colnme: This is the column within each codelist to want to search through
        dimension: This is the name of the dimension for naming output files
